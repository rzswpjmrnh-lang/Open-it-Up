    I don’t really know the perfect way to say this, but I just wanted you to know that having you in my life genuinely means a lot to me. You bring a calm I didn’t realize I was missing, and somehow even the quiet moments feel better when I think of you. I’m really grateful for you — for who you are, for the way you exist, and for the small, unspoken things that make you *you*. I hope you know how special you are to me, today and always. 🤍
